\title{
  Audio sample class and constructor
}
\description{
  \code{audioSample} is a class encapsulating digitalized (sampled)
  audio data. Essentially it tags numeric vectors and matrices with
  additional audio information (most importantly sample rate).

  \code{audioSample} is the designated constructor of such objects.

  Instances of the \code{audioSample} are numeric vectors or matrices
  with the following additional attributes:

  \itemize{
    \item{rate}{sample rate (in Hz), mandatory}
    \item{bits}{resolution of the source (in bits), optional}
  }

  If the object itself is a vector, it contains only one
  channel. Otherwise it is a matrix with as many rows as there are
  channels (hence 2 for stereo).

  \code{as.audioSample} generic converts an object into an audio
  sample object. The default method is very similar to the constructor
  except that it attempts to infer the parameters from the object's
  attributes if they are not specified. Thus they are optional although
  they don't have visible defaults.

\usage{
  audioSample(x, rate=44100, bits=16, clip = TRUE)
  as.audioSample(x, \dots)
  \method{as.audioSample}{default}(x, rate, bits, clip, \dots)
  \method{as.audioSample}{Sample}(x, \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{object to convert or initialize with}
  \item{rate}{sample rate}
  \item{bits}{resolution of the source. It doesn't affect the data
  itself and is only used for playback and export.}
  \item{clip}{boolean value determining whether the source should be
  clipped to a range between -1 and 1. Values outside this range
  result in undefined behavior.}
  \item{normalize}{boolean value determining whether the source should be
  normalized to a range between -1 and 1 before clipping.}
  \item{\dots}{parameters passed to the object-specific method}
}
\value{
  \code{audioSample} and \code{as.audioSample} return an audio sample
  object.
